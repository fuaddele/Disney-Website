        Thanks to the Age of Information most of us know a bit about business; we have a rough notion of the meaning
        of ‘turnover’ and ‘expenditure’, and experience at first-hand a company’s changes to its ‘product lines’.
        We also have an idea about what makes one tumble or thrive, and every so often we see a company singled
        out because of what it produces. Disney is one such company.

        The company’s ability to cross different types of media is another reason for its success. Shows especially
        for children on channels dedicated to the Disney brand feature characters from its well-known films, and
        many of the films have straight-to-video sequels that are equally as popular. Disney makes movies into shows
        and shows into movies. High School Musical, Hannah Montana and Suite Life of Zack and Cody did well when
        released in theatres.
